I'm a technical recruiter, sourcer and Talent Acquisition manager with about 15 years of experience in the field. Besides the usual recruiting stuff, I write basic scripts in JavaScript to save time on the repetitive actions in the browser, write SQL queries, create recruiting ChatBots, and always look for a way to streamline the process.
